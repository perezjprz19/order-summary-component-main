## My process

During my last project I had a hard time with overflow on very narrow devices. So this project, I
really focused on the mobile first-approach, even more so than before.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

<ul>
  <li> border-radius takes 4 value </li>
</ul>

### Continued development

My main struggle during this challenge was getting the paragraph aligned correctly. I forgot text-align existed in CSS. It didn't need to be as complicated as I was making it. I think I need to focus on not overthinking the simple things.

### Useful resources

-https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border-radius/ - This helped me because I needed to set only the top border-radius for the image on the card and I wasn't aware I could specify the radius for each border individually. It was very quick to grasp the concept at a glance.
